## Virtual Wallpaper Visualisation
It would be better to come up with a better name for this method. The method is, if a user uploads a image of the wall of a room and the design of a wallpaper, the method generates a, image of the room with that same wall paper applied on the walls. This has multiple unique ideas on how the super imposition of the wallpaper is done and how the process is optimised to run in real time.
## Media Compression Using GANs(One extra author)
Using GANs to compress Images or vide streams. The method is, train a GAN, on a domain f image, then pass the image needs to be compressed, on getting acceptable result, share the noise used to generate the image, on the receiver end, use that noise to regenerate the image, since the weights of both the GANs( sender and receiver s same ) the same image will be generated. The model is optimised using quantisation and knowledge distillation for feasible deployment on edge devices
- google scholar papers use their method for comparative study.

## A network scalable media application system design for real time information sharing(One extra author)

In many industry different kind of instructions needs to be displayed in different stations or sections of the industry. To digitise the process, we had to design the system. We build up the communication fabric and light weight protocol, so that the system can run on embedded devices like LCD/LED screens
- survey - cumulative of the methods ( pub/sub and display stuff)

## System Design for multiple Real Time Streaming Protocols consumption for safety helmet violation detection in industry setting.(One extra author)
I don't know if we can get any paper out of it but it just seem a quirky idea to put in. The method is take multiple streams of video from CCTV of any industry floor and apply simple helmet detection method and tracking, but our contribution os the design and implementation of the consumption of multiple CCTV streams and doing those detections in real time
